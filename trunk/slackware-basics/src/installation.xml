<title>Installing &Distribution;</title>

<sect1>
<title>Booting the installation CD-ROM</title>

<para>
The easiest method for booting the installation system is by using the
installation CD-ROM. The &Distribution; installation CD-ROM is a bootable CD,
which means that the BIOS can boot the CD, just like it can boot, for
example, a floppy disk. Most modern systems have a BIOS which supports
CD-ROM booting.
</para>

<para>
If the CD is booted when you have the CD inserted in the CD-ROM drive
during the system boot, the boot sequence is probably not correctly
configured in the BIOS. Enter the BIOS setup (usually by this can be
done by holding the "Del" or "Esc" key when the BIOS screen appears)
and make sure the CD-ROM is on the top of the list in the boot sequence.
If you are using a SCSI CD-ROM you may have to set the boot sequence
in the SCSI BIOS instead of the system BIOS. Consult the SCSI card manual
for more information. 
</para> 

<para>
After booting the installation system, you will be asked whether you
are using a special (national) keyboard layout or not. If you have 
a normal US/International keyboard, which are the most common, you can
just press "Enter" at this question. After that the login prompt will
appear. Log on as <quote>root</quote>, no password will be requested. 
After logging on the shell is started, and you can start installing
&Distribution;. The installation procedure will be explained briefly in 
this chapter.
</para>
</sect1>

<sect1>
<title>Partitioning a hard disk</title>

<para>
Installing &Distribution; requires at least one Linux partition, creating
a swap partition is also recommended. To be able to create a partition there
has to be free unpartitioned space on the disk. There are some programs
that can resize partitions. For example, FIPS can resize FAT partitions.
Commercial programs like Partition Magic can also resize other partition
types.
</para>

<para>
After booting the &Distribution; CD-ROM and logging on, there are two
partitioning programs at your disposal: <command>fdisk</command> and
<command>cfdisk</command>. <command>cfdisk</command> is the easiest of
both, because it is controlled by a menu interface. This section
describes the <command>cfdisk</command> program.
</para>

<para>
To partition the first harddisk you can simply execute
<command>cfdisk</command>. If you want to partition another disk or
a SCSI disk you have to specify which disk you want to partition
(<command>cfdisk /dev/device</command>). An ATA hard disks have the following
device naming: <filename>/dev/hdn</filename>, <quote>n</quote> is replaced
by a character. E.g. the <quote>primary master</quote> is named
<filename>/dev/hda</filename>, the <quote>secondary slave</quote> is
named <filename>/dev/hdd</filename>. SCSI disks are named in the following
way: <filename>/dev/sdn</filename>, <quote>n</quote> is replaced by
the device character (the first SCSI disk = a, the fourth SCSI disk = d). 
</para>

</figure>

<para>
After starting <command>cfdisk</command> currently existing partitions are
shown, as well as the amount of free space. The list of partitions can be
navigated with the <quote>up</quote> and <quote>down</quote> arrow keys.
At the bottom of the screen some commands are displayed, which can be
browsed with the <quote>left</quote> and <quote>right</quote> arrow keys.
A command can be executed with the &lt;Enter&gt; key. 
</para>

<para>
You can create a Linux partition by selecting <quote>Free Space</quote>
and executing the <quote>New</quote> command. <command>cfdisk</command>
will ask you whether you want to create a primary or logical partition.
The number of primary partitions is limited to four. Linux can be installed
on both primary and logical partitions. If you want to install other
operating systems besides &Distribution; that require primary partitions,
it is a good idea to install &Distribution; onto a logical partition.
The type of the new partition is automatically set to <quote>Linux
Native</quote>, so it is not necessary to set the partition type.
</para>

<para>
The creation of a swap partition involves the same steps as a normal
Linux partition, but the type of the partition has to be changed to
<quote>Linux Swap</quote> after the partition is created. The suggested
size of the swap partition depends on your own needs. The swap partition
is used to store programs if the main (RAM) memory is full. If you have
a harddisk of a reasonable size, it is a good idea to make a 256MB or
512MB swap partition, which should be enough for normal usage.
After creating the partition the partition type can be changed to
<quote>Linux Swap</quote>, by selecting the <quote>Type</quote>
command. The <command>cfdisk</command> program will ask for the type
number, <quote>Linux Swap</quote> partitions have type number 82.
Normally number 82 is already selected, so you can go ahead by pressing
the &lt;Enter&gt; key.
</para> 

<para>
If you are satisfied with the partitioning you can save the changes by
executing the <quote>Write</quote> command. This operation has to be
confirmed by entering <command>yes</command>. After saving the changes
you can quite <command>cfdisk</command> with the <command>Quit</command>
command. It is a good idea to reboot the computer before starting the
installation, to make sure that the partitioning changes are active.
Press &lt;ctrl&gt; + &lt;alt&gt; + &lt;del&gt; to shut Linux down and
restart the computer.

<title>Installing &Distribution;</title>

<para>
The &Distribution; installer is started by executing <command>setup</command>
in the installation disk shell. Setup will show a menu with several choices,
you can see a screenshot of the installer in <xref linkend="setup"/>. Every
option has to be completed to do a complete &Distribution; installation, but once
you start the <command>setup</command> guide will guide you through the
options.
</para>

<imagedata fileref="../images/setup.png" format="PNG" />
</imageobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>

<para>
The first part of the installation is named <quote>ADDSWAP</quote>. The
<command>setup</command> tool will look for a partition with the
<quote>Linux Swap</quote> type, and ask you if you want to format
and activate the swap partition (see figure <xref linkend="addswap"/>).
Normally you can just answer <quote>Yes</quote>.
</para>

<imagedata fileref="../images/addswap.png" format="PNG" />
</imageobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>

<para>
After setting the swap up space the <quote>TARGET</quote> menu is
launched, which you can see in <xref linkend="partselect"/>. It is used to 
initialize the &Distribution; partitions. Setup
will display all partitions with the <quote>Linux native</quote> type.
</para>

</imageobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>

<para>
After selecting one partition, the setup tool will ask whether you
want to format a partition or not, and if you want to format it,
whether you want to check the disk for bad sectors or not (<xref
linkend="fscheck"/>). Checking the disk can take a lot of time.
</para>

</imageobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>

<para>
After selecting whether you want to filesystem or not, you can specify which 
filesystem should be used (<xref linkend="filesystem"/>). Normally you can 
choose the ext2, ext3 and reiserfs filesystems. Ext2 was the standard Linux 
filesystem for many years, the disadvantage is that Ext2 does not support 
journaling. A journal is a special file or area of a partition in which all
filesystem operations are logged. When the system crashes the filesystem
can be repaired rapidly, because the kernel can use the log to see
what disk operations were performed. Ext3 is the same filesystem as
Ext2, but adds journaling. Reiserfs is a newer filesystem, that also provides
journaling. Besides that Reiserfs uses balanced trees, which make many
filesystem operations, especially when you are working with many small
files, faster than with Ext2 or Ext3. A disadvantage is that Reiserfs is
newer, that is why it can be a bit more unstable.

</figure>

<para>
The first initialized partition is automatically mounted as the root (/)
partition. For other partitions the mount point can be selected after
the initialization. You could, for example make separate partitions for
<filename>/</filename>, <filename>/var</filename>, <filename>/tmp</filename>,
<filename>/home</filename> and <filename>/usr</filename>. This provides
extra protection against crashes. For example the, <filename>/</filename> 
partition is barely changed after the installation if you create these
partitions. So, on the occasion of a crash, the chance that the
<filename>/</filename> partition was in the middle of a write operation
is much smaller.
</para>

<para>
The next step is to select the source medium (<xref linkend="medium"/>). This 
dialog offers several choices, like installing &Distribution; from a CD-ROM or 
installing &Distribution; via NFS. Most of the times &Distribution; is installed from
CD-ROM, so this is what we are going to look at. After selecting
<quote>CD-ROM</quote> you will be asked whether you want to let
setup look for the CD-ROM itself (<quote>Auto</quote>) or you want
to select the CD-ROM device yourself (<quote>Manual</quote>). If you 
select <quote>Manual</quote> the setup tool will show a list of
devices. Select the device holding the &Distribution; CD-ROM.
</para>

</figure>

<para>
After choosing an installation source the setup tool will ask you which
disk sets (series) you want to install packages from 
(<xref linkend="disksets"/>). A short description of each disk set is
listed.
</para>

<figure id="disksets">
<title>Selecting the disk sets</title>
<mediaobject>

<imagedata fileref="../images/disksets.png" format="PNG" />

</mediaobject>
</figure>

<para>
Now it is almost time to start the real installation. The next screen
asks how you would like to install. The most obvious choices are
<quote>full</quote>, <quote>menu</quote> or <quote>expert</quote>.
Selecting <quote>full</quote> will install all packages in the
selected disk sets. This is the easiest way of installing &Distribution;.
The disadvantage of this choice is that it can take quite much disk
space. The <quote>menu</quote> option will ask you for each disk set
which packages you want to install. The <quote>expert</quote> option
is almost equal to the <quote>menu</quote> option, but allows you
to deselect some very important packages from the <quote>a</quote>
disk set.
</para>

<para>
After the completion of the installation the setup tool will allow you to
configure some parts of the system. The first dialog will ask you where
you would like to install the kernel from (see 
<xref linkend="installkernel" />). Normally it is a good idea to install
the kernel from the &Distribution; CD-ROM, this will select the kernel you
installed &Distribution; with. You can confirm this, or select another kernel.
</para>

<imagedata fileref="../images/kernel.png" format="PNG" />
</imageobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>

<para>
At this point you can choose to make a bootdisk (<xref linkend="bootdisk" />).
It is a good idea to make a bootdisk, you can use it to boot &Distribution; if
the LILO configuration is botched.
</para>

</figure>

<para>
The following dialog can be used to make a link, 
<filename>/dev/modem</filename>, that points to your modem device. If
you do not have a modem you can select <emphasis>no modem</emphasis>.
</para>

<figure id="modem">

</mediaobject>
</figure>

<para>
The next step is to select whether you would like to use hotplug.
Hotplug is used for automatically configuring pluggable USB, PCMCIA
and PCI devices. Generally speaking it is a good idea to enable
hotplugging, but some systems may have problems with the probing
of the hotplug scripts.
</para>

<imagedata fileref="../images/hotplug.png" format="PNG" />
</imageobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>

<para>
The following steps are important, the next dialogs will assist
you with installing LILO, the Linux bootloader. Unless you have
experience in configuring LILO it is a good idea to choose 
to use the <emphasis>simple</emphasis> option for configuration of LILO, 
which tries to configure LILO automatically (<xref linkend="liloinstall" />).
</para>

<figure id="liloinstall">
<title>Selecting the kind of LILO installation</title>
<mediaobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="../images/lilo.png" format="PNG" />
</imageobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>

<para>
After selecting the <emphasis>simple</emphasis> option the LILO configuration 
utility will asks you whether you would like to use a framebuffer or not.
Using a framebuffer will allow you to use the console in several resolutions,
with other dimensions than the usual 80x25 characters. Some people who
use the console extensively prefer to use a framebuffer, which allows
them to keep more text on the screen. If you do not want a framebuffer
console, or if you are not sure, you can choose <emphasis>standard</emphasis>
here.
</para>

<figure id="framebuffer">
<title>Choosing the framebuffer resolution</title>
<mediaobject>
<imageobject>
<imagedata fileref="../images/framebuffer.png" format="PNG" />
</imageobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>

<para>
After setting the framebuffer you can pass extra parameters to the
kernel. This is normally not necessary, if you do not want to pass
extra parameters you can just press the &lt;Enter&gt; key.
</para>

<para>
The last step of the LILO configuration is selecting where LILO
should be installed. <emphasis>MBR</emphasis> is the master boot
record, the main boot record of PCs. Use this option if you want
use &Distribution; as only OS, or if you want to use LILO the boot
other operating systems. The <emphasis>Root</emphasis> option will
install LILO in the boot record of the &Distribution; <filename>/</filename>
partition. Use this option if you use another bootloader.
</para>
