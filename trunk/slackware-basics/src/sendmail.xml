    <para>
      Sendmail is the default Mail Transfer Agent (<acronym>MTA</acronym>)
      that &Distribution; uses. sendmail was originally written by Eric
      Allman, who still maintains sendmail. The primary role of the sendmail
      MTA is delivering messages, either locally or remotely. Delivery
      is usually done through the SMTP protocol. The means that sendmail
      can accept e-mail from remote sites through the SMTP port, and that
      sendmail delivers site destined for remote sites to other SMTP
      servers.

    <indexterm><primary>sendmail</primary><secondary>smarthost</secundary></indexterm>

    <para>
      Sendmail is available as the <emphasis>sendmail</emphasis> package
      in the <quote>n</quote> disk set. If you want to generate your own
      sendmail configuration files, the <emphasis>sendmail-cf</emphasis>
      package is also required. For information about how to install
      packages on &Distribution;, refer to
      <xref linkend="sysadmin-pkgmgmt" />.
    </para>

    <para>
      You can let &Distribution; start sendmail during each boot by
      making the <filename>/etc/rc.d/rc.sendmail</filename> executable.
      You can do this by executing:
    </para>

    <screen>
# <command>chmod a+x /etc/rc.d/rc.sendmail</command>
    </screen>

    <para>
      You can also start, stop and restart sendmail by using
      <emphasis>start</emphasis>, <emphasis>stop</emphasis>, and
      <emphasis>restart</emphasis> as a parameter to the sendmail
      initialization script. For example, you can restart sendmail
      in the following way:
    </para>

    <screen>
# <command>/etc/rc.d/rc.sendmail restart</command>
    </screen>
  </sect1>	

  <sect1 id="email-sendmail-configuration">
    <title>Configuration</title>

    <para>
      The most central sendmail configuration file is
      <filename>/etc/mail/sendmail.cf</filename>; this is where the 
      behavior of sendmail is configured, and where other files
      are included. The syntax of <filename>/etc/mail/sendmail.cf</filename>
      is somewhat obscure, because this file is compiled from a
      much simpler <filename>.mc</filename> files that uses M4 macros
      that are defined for sendmail.
    </para>

    <para>
      Some definitions can easily be changed in the
      <filename>/etc/mail/sendmail.cf</filename> file, but for other
      changes it is better to create your own <filename>.mc</filename>
      file. Examples in this chapter will be focused on creating a
      customized mc file.
    </para>

    <sect2 id="email-sendmail-configuration-mc">
      <title>Working with mc files</title>
    
      <indexterm><primary>sendmail</primary><secondary>mc files</secundary></indexterm>

      <para>
        In this section we will look how you can start off with an
        initial mc file, and how to compile your own .cf file to a
        cf file. There are many interesting example mc files available
        in <filename>/usr/share/sendmail/cf/cf</filename>. The most
        interesting examples are <filename>sendmail-slackware.mc</filename>
        (which is used for generating the default &Distribution;
        <filename>sendmail.cf</filename>), and
        <filename>sendmail-slackware-tls.mc</filename> which adds
        TLS support to the standard &Distribution; sendmail configuration.
        If you want to create your own sendmail configuration, it is
        a good idea to start with a copy of the standard &Distribution;
        mc file. For instance, suppose that we would like to create
        a configuration file for the server named <emphasis>straw</emphasis>,
        we could execute:
      </para>

      <screen>
# <command>cd /usr/share/sendmail/cf/cf</command>
# <command>cp sendmail-slackware.mc sendmail-straw.mc</command>
      </screen>

      <para>
        and start editing <filename>sendmail-straw.mc</filename>. After
        the configuration file is modified to our tastes, M4 can be used
        to compile a cf file:
      </para>

      <screen>
# <command>m4 sendmail-straw.mc &gt; sendmail-straw.cf</command>
      </screen>

      <para>
        If we want to use this new configuration file as the default
        configuration, we can copy it to
        <filename>/etc/mail/sendmail.cf</filename>:
      </para>

      <screen>
# <command>cp sendmail-straw.cf /etc/mail/sendmail.cf</command>
      </screen>

      <title>Using a smarthost</title>

      <indexterm><primary>sendmail</primary><secondary>smarthost</secundary></indexterm>

      <para>
        If you would like to use another host to deliver e-mail to
        remote locations you can set up sendmail to use a <quote>smart
        host</quote>. You do this by defining
        <emphasis>SMART_HOST</emphasis> in your mc file. For example,
        if you want to use <emphasis>smtp2.example.org</emphasis>
        as the smart host, you can add the following line:
      </para>

      <screen>
define(`SMART_HOST',`stmp2.example.org')
      </screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="email-sendmail-configuration-accepthosts">
      <title>Alternative host/domain names</title>

      <indexterm><primary>sendmail</primary><secondary>local host names</secundary></indexterm>

      <para>
        By default sendmail will accept mail destined for localhost, and the
        current hostname of the system. You can simply add additional hosts
        or domains to accept e-mail for. The first step is to make sure that 
        the following line is added to your mc configuration:
      </para>

      <screen>
FEATURE(`use_cw_file')dnl
      </screen>

      <para>
        When this option is enabled you can add host names and domain
        names to accept mail for to
        <filename>/etc/mail/local-host-names</filename>. This file
        is a newline separated database of names. For example, the file
        could look like this:
      </para>

      <screen>
example.org
mail.example.org
www.example.org
      </screen>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="email-sendmail-configuration-mapaddr">
      <title>Virtual user table</title>

      <indexterm><primary>sendmail</primary><secondary>virtual user table</secundary></indexterm>

      <para>
        Often you may want to map e-mail addresses to user names. This
        is needed when the user name differs from the part before the
        <quote>@</quote> part of an e-mail address. To enable this
        functionality, make sure the following line is added to your
        mc file:
      </para>

      <screen>
FEATURE(`virtusertable',`hash -o /etc/mail/virtusertable.db')dnl
      </screen>

      <para>
        The mappings will now be read from
        <filename>/etc/mail/virtusertable.db</filename>. This is a
        binary database file that should not directly edit. You can
        edit <filename>/etc/mail/virtusertable</filename> instead,
        and generate <filename>/etc/mail/virtusertable.db</filename>
        from that file.
      </para>

      <para>
        The <filename>/etc/mail/virtusertable</filename> file is a simple
        plain text file. That has a mapping on each line, with an e-mail
        address and a user name separated by a tab. For example:
      </para>

      <screen>
john.doe@example.org    john
john.doe@mail.example.org        john
      </screen>

      <para>
        In this example both e-mail for
        <emphasis>john.doe@example.org</emphasis> and
        <emphasis>john.doe@mail.example.org</emphasis> will be
        delivered to the <emphasis>john</emphasis> account. It is
        also possible to deliver some e-mail destined for a domain
        that is hosted on the server to another e-mail address,
        by specifying the e-mail address to deliver the e-mail to
        in the second in the second column. For example:
      </para>

      <screen>
john.doe@example.org    john.doe@example.com
      </screen>

      <para>
        After making the necessary changes to the
        <filename>virtusertable</filename> file you can generate the
        database with the following command:
      </para>

      <screen>
# <command>makemap hash /etc/mail/virtusertable &lt; /etc/mail/virtusertable</command>
      </screen>
    </sect2>
  </sect1>
